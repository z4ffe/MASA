0. Create at the hosting dir mango/your-name/HW08 and put there the homework

1. Ternary operator inside ternary operator.

   a) Ask user to enter a number. Your output should be: "x < 70" 
      or "x > 210" or "x is between 70 and 210".

      CHALLENGE: With more ternary operators inside. Check if 
                 there is any input. Check if the input is numeric.
   
   b) Ask the user to enter his name (one variable) 
      and family name (another variable) and say 
      that you're happy to see him if his name is John Smith, 
      Jane Smith or Jack Daniels, otherwise tell him "go away".

      Check that the user enters not empty string and not null 
      (when clicking on "Cancel")

2. a) Write function avg(a, b, c) that gets 3 numeric parameters (arguments)
      and prints their average

   b) Write function avg2(a, b, c) that gets no parameters (arguments),
      asks user for three numbers, and prints their average

   c) Run the both functions couple of times, like:

      var x = 15, y = 20, z = 33;

      avg(x, y, z);
      avg(30, 40, 50);

      avg2();
      avg2();

3. Datatypes. Use typeof operator. You're going to check 
   datatypes and to use new functions parseInt() and parseFloat(). 

      -- Show which data type is empty string ('')
      -- Create new variable, but don't assign it a value.
         Show which data taype this variable is. 
      -- Show datatype of true and datatype of false 
         (they are not strings and shoud not be in quotes)
      -- Use function confirm() like this: 
         var answer = confirm('Are you agree?')
         Check which value is assigned to answer variable
         when you click on "OK" and when you click "Cancel"
      -- Run function parseInt() and function parseFloat() 
         on the next values: 15.5, '12asdf', '1024.34asdf', 
         7.82, 'asdf', '', null, undefined. 
         What is the output of each and what is it's data type?
         (You may do this by creating and using a function, like 

         function checkParse(str) { 

            console.log(`parseInt(${str}) value: ${parseInt(str)}, datatype: ${typeof parseInt(str)}`);

            console.log(`parseFloat(${str}) value: ${parseFloat(str)}, datatype: ${typeof parseFloat(str)}`);

         }

         checkParse(15.5);
         checkParse('12asdf');
         checkParse('1024.34asdf');
         checkParse(7.82);
         checkParse('asdf');
         checkParse('');
         checkParse(null);
         checkParse(undefined);

         )

4. Calculate age. Write function that gets a birth year 
    of a person, birth month and birth day,
    gets the current date by the next statements:

        var currDate = new Date();
        var currYear = currDate.getFullYear();
        var currMonth = currDate.getMonth();
        var currDay = currDate.getDate();

   and returns the age of the person. Pay attention that getMonth() 
   returns month number (0 - January, 1 - February, 2 - March, etc.),
   so you may make month input by number too.

5. Write a function that gets first name, birth year, month, day 
    and the age of retirement, uses "calculate age" function 
    from the previous exercise and outputs to the console 
    results like "John is going to retire 14 years from now",
    "Jane is already retired".

6. Copy by HTML and CSS some part of the table 
             of the olympic days from the picture of the table:
             Olympics-2016-tab-practice.jpeg

             For the symbols you may use the pictures from 
             ./img/olympic/ directory.

             Pay attention that *.svg files can be used like 
             regular images at <img> tag.

             There is no need to copy the whole table, just
             a part - to ensure that you know how to do this.
