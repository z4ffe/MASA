1. Continue working on binary-guessing project.
   Start Mode2 (till 26.10.2022).

2. css-explanator project (till 30.10.2022).
   First steps: Choose CSS properties to explain 
   and divide css-explanator.html into 4 parts.
   The example is at css-explanator-example.png 

3. Square. Loop inside loop. Get n - size of the square. 
   Create a number square. For example, for n = 4, the square should be:

   1  2  3  4
   2  4  6  8
   3  6  9 12
   4  8 12 16

4. Create multiplication table from 1 to 10.
   Loop inside loop. 

   a) like mult-tab-ex02.png 

   b) like mult-tab-ex03.png 

5. loop inside loop 
   DO WHILE or WHILE. 
   const countries = ['Israel','Spain','Great Britain','Hungary','Egypt','Lebanon']
   const capitals = ['Jerusalem','Madrid','London','Budapest','Cairo','Beirut']

   Show the player the country names one by one. He should answer the name
   of the capital of the country. Stop when you get the right answer.

6. map()
    const numAr1 = [4.5, 64, 1024, 81, 10000, 3.1];
    a) Create array of square roots of numAr1 

    b) In the same map() loop create array of square roots of numAr1 and
       array of squares of numAr1 (for one of them you use map, 
       for the second - the usual push())

    c) Create array numAr2 which elements are constructed from
       the elements of numAr1 minus their index

7. Floyd triangle. Challenge. Input: how many rows should contain the triangle.
   The triangle should consist of sequential numbers.
   For example, if the input is 5, the triangle:
   1
   2  3
   4  5  6
   7  8  9  10
   11 12 13 14 15

   Use anonymous function definition as callback inside 
   the addEventListener function.
