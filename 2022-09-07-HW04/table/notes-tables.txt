HTML Tables
------------------
When to use
1. For layout of data
2. Not for layout of the whole screen
   - because there is no semantic meaning 
     for the <table> tag
   - <table> tags not make the data accessible
   - there are more convenient or modern layout tools 
     like float, position, flex, grid

Olympics data for example

HTML table consists of the main parts:
-----------------------------------------

table
   thead
   tbody
   tfoot

html table
-----------------
<table> - we use it for the content, not for the layout
<thead> - important for the search engins and readers
<tbody> - the contents
<tfoot> - usually contains statistics, like summaries, averages, etc.
          You do not see <tfoot> often (usually it is omitted) 

          <thead>, <tbody> and <tfoot> are comprised of the table rows <tr>,
          and the table rows are comprised of <td> or <th>

<tr> - table row
<td> - table data
<th> - table header

    HTML table "has no columns", it has rows <tr> and inside each <tr> 
    it has <td> (table data) cells or <th> (table header - their data 
    is bold and centered) cells.
    We may say that <th> and <td> which are placed one above another 
    comprise a column.

Table borders 
----------------------------------------------------------------
Border of each table element is only it's border. 
For example if we create border for <table>, it's only 
the external table border, no table part gets it's border from it.
If we create border for <tr>, each table row will get this border,
but no <td> or <th> will have it.

border-collapse - property that enables merging of the borders 
                  of the different parts of the table
