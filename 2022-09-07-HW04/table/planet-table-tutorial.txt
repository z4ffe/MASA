1. Read notes-tables.txt, it is the general explanation of the tags 
   
2. We're going to copy the next table: planet-table.jpeg

3. Create planet-table.html and create by "!" the usual HTML template:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>
    
</body>
</html>

4. Change title to "Planet Table" and create ./css/planet-table.css 
   and connect it to planet-table.html 
   
5. Create the general structure of the table (we omit <tfoot):

    <table>
        <thead>

        </thead>
        <tbody>
            
        </tbody>
    </table>

6. Now put one row into <thead>:
   
   <thead>:

            <tr>
                <td></td>
                <td>Name</td>
                <td>Mass<br>(10<span class="super">24</span>kg)</td>
                <td>Diameter<br>(km)</td>
                <td>Dencity<br>(kg/m<sup class="smaller">3</sup>)</td>
                <td>Gravity</td>
                <td>Length<br>of day</td>
                <td>Distance<br>from sun</td>
                <td>Mean<br>temperature</td>
            </tr>

7. Pay attention 
   
     a) the first <td> is emtpy
        
     b) there are 2 ways to create "superscript" text:
          one - is to use HTML tag <sup> 
          second - by CSS 
        
     c) to use the second way we created the class "super",
        now we added to the CSS file:

        .super {
            vertical-align: super;
            font-size: 75%;
        }

     d) the text in <sup> a little bit big, so we created 
        the class "smaller", and added to the CSS file:

        .smaller {
            font-size: 75%;
        }

8. MISSION: a) add two more <td> - "Number of moons" and "Notes"
            b) add units (like in the picture) to the <td> of "Gravity"
               - with <sup> tag 
            c) add units (like in the picture) to the <td> 
               of "Length of day"
            d) add units (like in the picture) to the <td>
               "Distance from Sun" - with .super class (using CSS)
            e) add units (like in the picture) to the <td>
               "Mean temperature" - use the code of HTML entity 
               named "degree"

9. Insert the next 4 rows into <tbody>:

            <tr>
                <td>Terrestrial</td>
                <td>Mercury</td>
                <td>0.330</td>
                <td>4,879</td>
                <td>5427</td>
                <td>3.7</td>
                <td>4222.6</td>
                <td>57.9</td>
                <td>167</td>
                <td>0</td>
                <td>Closest to the Sun</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Terrestrial</td>
                <td>Venus</td>
                <td>4.87</td>
                <td>12,104</td>
                <td>5243</td>
                <td>8.9</td>
                <td>2802.0</td>
                <td>108.2</td>
                <td>464</td>
                <td>0</td>
                <td></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Terrestrial</td>
                <td>Earth</td>
                <td>5.97</td>
                <td>12,756</td>
                <td>5514</td>
                <td>9.8</td>
                <td>24.0</td>
                <td>149.6</td>
                <td>15</td>
                <td>1</td>
                <td>Our world</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Terrestrial</td>
                <td>Mars</td>
                <td>0.642</td>
                <td>6,792</td>
                <td>3933</td>
                <td>3.7</td>
                <td>24.7</td>
                <td>227.9</td>
                <td>-65</td>
                <td>2</td>
                <td>The red planet</td>
            </tr>

10. Now the borders.
    Try at the CSS file:

    table {
        border: 1px solid black;
    }

    Exchange it by:

    table, td {
        border: 1px solid black;
    }

    Nice, right? But how we make one border?

    Add also (this merges all the duplicate borders into one):

    table {
        border-collapse: collapse;
    }

11. Now we want to make the headers distinctive. So, inside <thead> 
    exchange all the <td> by <th> ("table header").

    Pay attention that now it is BOLD and CENTERED. 

    BUT WHERE ARE THE BORDERS?

    So we should add "th" to the list:

    table, td, th {
        border: 1px solid black;
    }

12. MISSION: make padding of 7px inside all the cells.

13. CHECK 1. Check the files. Compare what you have now
    to the files planet-table-check1.css and planet-table-check1.html 

14. Now we want to make the left cell "Terrestrial" not
    repeat itself 4 times but span over 4 rows. 

    So we delete it (<td>Terrestrial</td>) from the rows of 
    "Venus","Earch" and "Mars".

    Now the order of the columns has been broken.

    But at the row of "Mercury" we use rowspan:

        <td rowspan="4">Terrestrial</td>

    and it fixes everything.

15. We add one more row:

            <tr>
                <td rowspan=4>Jovian<br>planets</td>
                <td rowspan=2>Gas<br>giants</td>
                <td>Jupiter</td>
                <td>1898</td>
                <td>142,984</td>
                <td>1326</td>
                <td>23.1</td>
                <td>9.9</td>
                <td>778.6</td>
                <td>-110</td>
                <td>67</td>
                <td>The largest planet</td>
            </tr>

    Pay attention for the "rowspan"s at the first 2 cells.
    We prepare "Jovian planets" to span over 4 rows 
    and "Gas giants" to span over 2 rows.

    But again the order of the columns has been broken.

    It is because "Terrestrial" should span over 2 columns:
    "Jovian planets" and "Gas giants".

    So we fix it with "colspan":

    <td rowspan="4" colspan="2">Terrestrial</td>

    But the headers are still not OK, so we fix them by adding 
    "collspan" to the first empty <th>:

    <th colspan="2"></th>

16. Add 4 more rows:

            <tr>
                <td>Saturn</td>
                <td>568</td>
                <td>120,536</td>
                <td>687</td>
                <td>9.0</td>
                <td>10.7</td>
                <td>1433.5</td>
                <td>-140</td>
                <td>62</td>
                <td></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Ice<br>Giants</td>
                <td>Uranus</td>
                <td>86.8</td>
                <td>51,118</td>
                <td>1271</td>
                <td>8.7</td>
                <td>17.2</td>
                <td>2872.5</td>
                <td>-195</td>
                <td>27</td>
                <td></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Neptune</td>
                <td>102</td>
                <td>49,528</td>
                <td>16.38</td>
                <td>11.0</td>
                <td>16.1</td>
                <td>4495.1</td>
                <td>-200</td>
                <td>14</td>
                <td></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Dwarf planets</td>
                <td>Pluto</td>
                <td>0.0146</td>
                <td>2,370</td>
                <td>2095</td>
                <td>0.7</td>
                <td>153.3</td>
                <td>5906.4</td>
                <td>-225</td>
                <td>5</td>
                <td>Declassified as a planet in 2006</td>
            </tr>

17. MISSION: 
    a) fix the span of "Ice giants"

    b) fix the span of "Dwarf planets"

    c) make "Terrestrial planets", "Jovian planets", "Dwarf planets", 
       "Gas giants", "Ice giants" and all the planet names 
       BOLD and CENTERED

    d) right after the tag <table> add the tag <caption> with 
       the text: "Data about the planets of our solar system".
       Make it's font bigger by 25% and make the space of 5px 
       between the caption and the table

18. CHECK 2. Check the files. Compare what you have now
    to the files planet-table-check2.css and planet-table-check2.html
