DO NOT FORGET TO CONVERT STRING from prompt()
TO NUMBER if needed


1. /* There are 2 variables with the values: name of the person 
         and their birth year. 
      Use two more variables, to get the current date and 
             to calculate the age. 
      If the age is not dividible by 10, congratulate 
           the person at the console
      (or by document.write(str)), like in the example: 
             "Yosi, congratulations, you're 16!" 
      If the age is ended by 0, congratulate the person 
          at the console
      (or by document.write(string)) like this: 
      "Yosy, congratulations with your 40th anniversary!". 
      If this person is also older than 60, show at the console
      (or by document.write(string)) too: "Оооо, you're like Methuselach!" */

2. /* Ask user to enter 3 different numbers. 
      When the user enters the 2nd number, check 
      if it is not equal to the first.
      If it is equal, use function alert() to tell the user that
      it was wrong input. For example, 
      alert('The first and the second numbers are equal. \nWrong input!')
      Show at the console the maximal number of the 3.  */

3. Like we did for logic operators, 
   fill the next table for binary addition.

   Is it more like "&&" or like "||"?

//   +   |   0   |   1 
//----------------------
//   0   |       |          
//   1   |       |      

4. Leap year. You program gets a year. It should use % and 
   answer if the given year is a leap year. If a year 
   is not divisible by 4 then it is not leap,
   if it is divisible by 4 but not by 100 - it is leap,
   if it is divisible by 400 - it is leap (like 2000 was),
   if it is divisible by 100 but not by 400 - it is not leap
   (like 1900 was).

5. Aquarelle. Create several columns from rectangles of the same
color but with the different transparency - use <table>. Possible
output you see at Aquarelle.JPG. Colors - your choice
