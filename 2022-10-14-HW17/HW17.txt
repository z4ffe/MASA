1. Till 18.10.2022 finish the first steps of the PORTFOLIO mission:
   according to the file portfolio.txt

2. The First Project. First version till 18.10.2022,
   and we'll discuss it then - to explain how we can shorten the loop.
   Is it a PRIME number?
   Put it into mango/your-name/prime-num dir.

   The user should enter a number into an input field.
   By clicking the button the user should get the answer,
   if the number is prime or not.

   Prime numbers are the numbers that are dividable by 
   one and by themselves only, like 17, 29.
   2 - is the smallest prime number.
   Not 0 and not 1 are not considered prime numbers.
   Negative and not integer numbers are not valid input.

   Check if the input number is valid and is not 1 or 0,
   and after that use loop to check if the number 
   is dividable by some number except of 1 and itself.

   Try to make the loop as short as possible.

   Put the project into the dir digi/your-name/prime-number

   Good luck!

3. Training for loops and arrays - level05.txt

4. Training for ternary operator inside ternary operator
   and DOM manipulations - level06.txt

5. Two-number calculator - continued from HW09. 
*** NEW-NEW-NEW ***: No listeners - "onclick" attribute.
Change the old Two-Number Calculator that is located 
in mango/your-name/two-num-calc directory.

No prompt(), no SWITCH.

   <!-- Step 1: - 2 input fields with the labels
                  - buttons "+", "-", "*", "/", "*", "%", "^"
                  - output div or paragraph -->
   <!-- Step 2: in JS create 3 global variables -
                  - for 2 inputs
                  - and for output -->
   <!-- Step 3: write function getInput() that gets
                  the values from input and puts them 
                  into the global variables -->
   <!-- Step 4: write function setOutput(txt) that
                  gets text as parameter and sets it as 
                  the innerText of the output div or paragraph -->
   <!-- Step 5: go over the functions add(), subtract(), multiply(), divide(), 
                divideIntegers(), power() and add run inside of each
                at the beginning - getInput(),
                at the end - setOutput(outputText)


    

        and add them to the button "onclick" attribute,
        Example: 
           <button onClick="add();">+</button>
           <button onClick="subtract();">-</button>
