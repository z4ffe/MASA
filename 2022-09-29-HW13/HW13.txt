1. PORTFOLIO - the first steps.
   According to the file portfolio.txt

2. "while (true)" and "break".
   a) Multiply until zero. User enters numbers, the app multiplies them. It should
      stop if the number is zero 

   b) Password rules. User is asked to enter a password, 
      in accordance with the next rules:
      - it's length should be between 5 and 12 letters,
      - it should start from uppercase letter,
      - it should end by "!" or "?"
      The program stops when the rules are fulfilled 

   c) Create "while(true)" loop which asks the user if he wants 
       to go to a theater. If the answer is "Yes/yes/YES", 
       say "Here are your tickets" and stop. If the answer is 
       "No/no/NO" just stop. Otherwise continue asking.

   d) const ar1 = [5, -12, 1.3, 'BluE','black',0.45, 'wHIte',100,2.01, 'ReD']
       const ar2 = []
       const ar3 = [7, 9.1]
       const ar4 = ['GREEN']
       
    Create a function that gets an array, goes over it 
       with "while" loop 
       and if the current element is not a number, it converts 
       it to lowercase. If it is a number the loop should "continue".

       Run the function 4 times - with each of the above arrays.

       (Hints: 1. Declare i before the loop and assign it zero 
               2. Don't forget to check if i already at the end 
                  of the array - at the condition of the loop)


3. indexOf + while challenge. Write function findAll(),
   that gets a word and a letter.
   Go over the word and get all the locations of the given letter 
   and return them in an array. 

   For example

   findAll('archaebacteria','a') returns [0,4,7,13]
   findAll('abracadabra','a') returns [0,3,5,7,10]
   findAll('encyclopedy','m') returns []
   findAll('encyclopedy','c') returns [2,4]
   findAll('encyclopedy','c') returns [2,4]
   findAll('error','e') returns [0]

   Check the function with all the above pairs of word and letter.


4. Continue "Like Wiki" pages.

   a) Make some divs or other elements to change when the mouse hover over them
   b) Use ch for the width of some paragraph
   c) Use somewhere selectors like:

      img[src="./img/lion.jpg"]  - with this attribute value
      
      div.percents - div with class percents
      .percents.orange - class percents together with class orange in the same element
      img#lion - img with id lion
      .green#lion - class green together with id lion
      
   d) Some parts with "rtl" languages 
   e) Some parts in different languages and use attribute "lang"

   f) Use attribute "title" above some inline tags to make pop-up saying something about the words
      inside these tags, like <span title="very important statement">lorem ipsum</span>

5. Create a function padWithStar(strAr,numAr,total).

   This function should get a string array, a number array 
   of the same length, and a number.

   It should go with the FOR loop over the arrays, take string from the
   string array and pad it from the START with STARS till the number 
   from the number array.
   After that it should pad the string from the END with STARS till 
   the "total" number and show it at the console.

        const ar1 = [' ','   ','     ','       ']
        const ar2 = ['',' ','   ','     ','       ','     ','   ',' ','']
        const arNum1 = [5,6,7,8]
        const arNum2 = [6,7,8,9]
        const arNum3 = [5,6,7,8,9,8,7,6,5]
        let tot1 = 9
        let tot2 = 11

   Run the function with the next presets:

        padWithStar(ar1,arNum1,tot1);
        padWithStar(ar1,arNum2,tot2);
        padWithStar(ar2,arNum3,tot2);

   Have you got 2 triangles and 1 diamond?

WHILE loop 

   const ar1 = ['Paris','London','Washington','Amsterdam','Kahir','Jerusalem','Tokyo','Athena']
   const ar2 = ['Paris','London','Washington','Amsterdam','Kahir','Tokyo','Athena']
   const ar3 = ['Jerusalem','Tel-Aviv','Ramat-Gan']
   const ar4 = ['Jerusalem']

   Create a function that gets an array, goes over it with "while" loop until 
   encounters 'Jerusalem'. At the end tell how many cities you visited before
   got to Jerusalem. If there is no Jerusalem, tell that you yet not got there.

   Run the function for the above arrays.
