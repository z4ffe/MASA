   b) Add /* ANAGRAMS */ part which will contain

      - function getting random word for anagram from
           "anagrams" array and showing it.
           This function should be triggered
               when clicking "New Anagram" button.

      - function findAnagrams() finding in the "anagrams" array 
            all the anagrams of the chosen word
            and showing them in the "comp-anagram" input
            (remember the alphabetic sorting trick!!!)
 
      - function checkPlayerAnswer() comparing the anagrams
            which the player put into "your-anagram" input
            with the anagrams
            which were found by the program

      - 2 arrays like

        const praises = ['Well done!',"You're the best!",'תותח','כל הכבוד'];
	const reprovals = ['Next time will be better',"You're stupid but cute","Don't blame yourself",'היה יכול להיות יותר גרוע'];

      - function showPraiseOrReproval() getting randomly praise from the "praises" array
           - in the case of player success,
           or getting randomly reproval from the "reprovals" array
           - in the case of player failure,
           and shoing it in the paragraph "anagram-reaction"

      - function checkAnagrams() which calls 
            findAnagrams(), and checkPlayerAnswer() and showPraiseOrReproval.
            This function should be triggered
            by "Check Anagram" button.
