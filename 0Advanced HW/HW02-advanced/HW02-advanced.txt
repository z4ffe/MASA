1. Take the "clock" files. 
    Make the three clock hands to rotate in accordance to the current
    hours, minutes, seconds.
    Make them tick.

    Hints:
    a. Each time you check time - change "transform: rotate(...deg)" property 
    of the hands

    b. Make transform-origin to be 100%, so the hands will rotate not
    around the middle, but around the right end 

    c. Add audio element to the html and run audio.play() each time 
    before you move the clock hands
