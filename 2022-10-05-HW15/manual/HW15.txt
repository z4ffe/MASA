1. Finish everything in level01.txt, level02.txt, level03.txt, level04.txt
   (there are "DO WHILE" missions somewhere too)

2. DOM manipulation. Continue with DOM01.html.
   a) In HTML create orange div. In JS add some text to it.

   b) In HTML create blue paragraph with the text: 
      "My favourite food is ". In JS add to the text "pizza".

3. Questionnaire. Use questionnaire.html and questions.js
   that you created in the class.

   a) Add at least 1 question more to the question array

   b) Before the loop add variable "score".
      For each right answer add 1 point, for each wrong answer
      subtract 2 points. After the loop show the final score

   c) Before the loop ask the player what's their name.
      Use it when talking to them.

   d) Each time after the player answers a question ask:
      "Do you want to stop the game? Y/y/N/n",
      and, if yes, "break" (don't forget to show the final score)

   e) Each time before asking the question, show the question 
      text and ask "Do you want to skip the question? Y/y/N/n", 
      and if "yes", use "continue" and show the next question.
      This way it happens that you show each question twice:
      first time to ask if the player wants to skip it and
      the second - to ask it really.

   f) When showing a question, show it with it's number
