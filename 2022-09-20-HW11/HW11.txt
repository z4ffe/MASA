1. Make changes to the navigation, that 
   was prepared earlier (like in inline-block-nav.html 
   and inline-block-nav.css) - cause it's buttons 
   to change while hovering over or clicking 
   and treat the links to look like you prefer

2. More of "for" loop.
   a) Get input number (small integer),  
      and draw a square with the side of this number of stars,
      for example (the number is 4): 
      ****
      ****
      ****
      ****

      The hint for this exercise is below all the exercises

   b) Write a function that gets a word, goes 
      over it's letters and creates new string,
      where vowels are omitted (without a,e,i,o,u).
      For example, it gets "strange" and returns "strng",
      gets "astonishment" and returns "stnshmnt".

      The hint for this exercise is below all the exercises

3. Arrays.
   a) var animals = ['cAt','DoG','giRaFFe','LION','tiGer','monkey']

      Go over the words in the array - exchange each word
      by the same word, but in the lowercase.

      Show the array after the loop.

      Can you change one word to lowercase and the next to uppercase and so on?

      Example of the output:
      console.log(`after the change "animals":`,animals);
      ['cat','DOG','giraffe','LION','tiger','MONKEY']

   b) Go over the previous array. For each word show at the console 
      the first and the last letter. Example (not neccessary to change the case):

                ct
                dg
                ge
                ln
                tr
                my

   c) Go over the previous array. Show the animals at the console 
      numbered by their order. Example:

               1. cat
               2. dog
               3. giraffe
               4. lion
               5. tiger
               6. monkey

   d) Do the same, but start from the end. Example:

               1. monkey
               2. tiger
               3. lion
               4. giraffe
               5. dog
               6. cat
      
   e) var adjectives = ['black','curious','spotted','scary','striped','happy']

      Go over the animal array and show each animal together with 
      an adjective. Example:

             black cat 
             curiuos dog
             spotted giraffe
             scary lion 
             striped tiger
             happy monkey

   f) Do the same, but combine the words in the reverse order. Example:

              happy cat
              striped dog
              scary giraffe
              spotted lion
              curious tiger 
              black monkey

   g) Go over the array of the words and combine them into one string.
      (Hint: declare the string before the loop and make it empty string)

      var words = ['I','am','never','too','late',',','the','others','are','just','too','early']

   h) Go over the array and find average of all the numbers:
      (Hint: you should find their sum, and when the loop stops, 
             divide the sum by the amount of numbers.
             So declare the variable of the sum before the loop
             and assign it zero)

      var num = [44, 22, 33, 11, -66, -88, 22, 33]

Hint for 2 a): use str.repeat()
Hint for 2 b): Create empty output string before the loop.
               Inside the loop body use IF that checks that
               the current letter not equal to 'a', 'e','i','o' 
               or 'u' - in the case that it is not a vowel,
               concatenate it with the output string.
