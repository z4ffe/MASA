1. Ternary operator practice.
   a) var adminPassword = 'Rxjel$#1hs';
      var admin1 = "Yosi", admin2 = "Noa", admin3 = "Yael"

      Ask the user their username and
      ask to enter a password.

      If the username is equal to one of the admin's names 
      and if the password is equal to adminPassword, 
      show message "You're redirected to the admin area"

      If it is wrong, alert "Access denied"

   b) Ask the user to enter a word in upper case.
      Say if it is OK, or not in upper case.

      Hint to how to make this check see below all the exercises.

3. Show opening hours of museum.

   Get current Date by "new Date()".
   Use function currentDate.getDay().

   it's open half day from 8:00 till 12:00,
   In the other days it should be open from 8:00 till 20:00.

   say "You're tall, you should eat more".
   If the height is between 160 and 170 and the weight is less
   than 80, say "You're height is great, why you're
