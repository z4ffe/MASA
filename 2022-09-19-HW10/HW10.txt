1. Add to your "like Wiki" page:
   a) Some table that uses colgroup tag and border-spacing property
      (see the example at colgroup-border-spacing.html/css)
   b) Some pictures that use shape-outside and object-fit properties
      (see the example at shape-outside.html/css)

2. FOR loop
   a) Write a function that gets a number and uses a "for" loop 
      to find a sum of all the numbers from 1 till this number (including), for example:

      sumFromOneTillNum(6);
      21

      sumFromOneTillNum(1);
      1

   b) Write a function that gets a number and uses a "for" loop 
      to show all the even numbers from 2 till this number (including it, if it is even).
      Show them in one row, for example:

      showEven(9);
      8 6 4 2

   c) Write a function that gets a string and uses a "for" loop 
      to show each letter from the end to the beginning.
      If you show them in one row - it means you reverted the word!

      For example:

      revertTheWord('cat');
      t a c

3. Pay attention. New string function: str.repeat(n).
   This function repeats the string n times.
   Write a function that gets a number, uses '*'.repeat() and creates right-angled triangle
   of stars with the given number of rows, for example:

   starTriangle(5);

   *
   **
   ***
   ****
   *****

4. Write a function that prepares the given word for "Hangman" game:
   it gets the word and returns string that consists of the first 
   and the last characters 
   of the word in upper case and the right number of hyphens between them. 
   Example outputs:

   console.log(prepareWordForHangman('strawberry'));
   
   S--------Y

   console.log(prepareWordForHangman('caramel'));

   C-----L

   console.log(prepareWordForHangman('I'));

   ERROR

   console.log(prepareWordForHangman(''));

   ERROR

   console.log(prepareWordForHangman());

   ERROR
