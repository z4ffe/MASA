    <p class="description">There's no tougher endurance race than Le Mans. Over 3,000 punishing miles in 24 hours at
        speeds
        often in excess of
        200 mph. Last year, Porsche took the first five places. This year, the first eight. Next year, who knows?
        There's
        always room for improvement. Even at Porsche.</p>
