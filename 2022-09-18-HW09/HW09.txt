1. Two-Number Calculator. 
   Put this program into mango/your-name/two-num-calc directory.
   The program gets by prompt() two numbers and a sign
   (three prompts in total), 
   and shows the result of the appropriate calculation.
   The sign should be one of: +, -, *, /, 
   % (should show the whole part and the remainder), ^ (power).
   Create functions add(), subtract(), multiply(), divide(), 
   divideIntegers(), power().
   Use switch. In each case call the appropriate function.
   
2. Write a function that gets a year and a month, 
   use switch(month) to return the number
   of days in the given month of this year.

   Remember that you know how to determine the number 
   of days in February.

   Hint is below all the missions.


3. FOR loop.

   a) Make the program to write 15 times
      `I'll never tell lies`

   b) Start from 3, go until 19. 
      Show all the odd numbers, 
      including 3 and 19.

   c) Go from 25 until -16.
      Starting with 25 and for each fifth
      number show it's square root 
      (use Math.sqrt()) if it is possible,
      and show it's absolute value 
      (use Math.abs())
 

      
Hint for 2: There are months that have the same number
            of days, like April, June, September, November.

            Stack their cases together without "break".
