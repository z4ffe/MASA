1. Birthdays. Get day, month and year of birth for two persons.
   (No need to make all the prompts, 
    you can just set them like this:

    var year1=1999, year2=1998, month1="May", month2="May", 
        day1=22, day2=22)

   If they were born on the same day, the program says: 
   You both were born on the same day exactly!
   If they were born on the same day but in different years, 
   the program says: you've got the same birth date!

2. a) Prompt the user for 3 numbers. 
      It's given that no two numbers are equal.   
      Show at the console the numbers from the smallest to the biggest, 
      like 6 < 8 < 122. 

      or

   b) CHALLENGE
      Some of the numbers may be equal. Show, if needed the equality, like:
      6 = 6 < 122

3. It was unusual for us to add together binary numbers.
But if we would need to add together larger binary numbers like 
111011 and 101010, HOW would you perform it?

4. Get an integer number by prompt(). Perform validation 
  (make sure that the input is valid - not empty, number, 
  integer - by Number.isInteger().
  Example of usage:
        if (Number.isInteger(num) === true) 
               console.log('this is integer'))

   Use ternary operator and tell if the number is even or odd.

5. The program gets 3 numbers. Use ternary operator to decide
   (without multiplying them!!!) if their product (произведение) 
   will be positive or negative

 
6. Like Wiki. Create 2 short "like wiki" 
   pages. Don't work on it too much, as
   it is an exercise, but funny is
   appreciated.
a) Remove default margins and padding from the elements.
b) Use float to surround a table and a picture with a text.
c) Create underlined section names.
d) Create "Table of contents" and create at least 1 link 
   to some inner section and 1 link 
   to some section of the second page.
